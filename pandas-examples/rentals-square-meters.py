# add another column to your dataframe that represents the "square meter rent" for each apartment

# --> here you divide each value from the 'Rent' column with the corresponding value of the 'Space' column
# --> this gives you back a 'Series' object
# the .round() function then basically just rounds each number in the series to the decimal places you specify 
rentals['m2_rent'] = (rentals['Rent'] / rentals['Space']).round(decimals=2)

# compute the average absolut rent for each region

# if you want the output from highest to lowest you can pass ascending=False

# to see the differences a bit clearer, it would be nice to combine the 2 dataframes
# while keeping the original "order" of the rows (so just a row-by-row merge). 
# result would be sth like
# Region_absolute, Rent, Region_m2, m2_rent
# Wedding, 847.13, KÃ¶penick, 15.63
# ...
# but i haven't found a trivial way to do that
